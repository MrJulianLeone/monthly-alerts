# Email Template Cleanup - Remove Duplicate Subject Lines

## Summary

Removed duplicate headings from email bodies where the subject line and the first heading (H1) were the same. This prevents redundancy and creates a cleaner email experience.

## Changes Made

### 1. Email Verification Template
**File**: `app/actions/email-verification.ts`
- **Subject**: "Verify Your Email Address"
- **Before**: Had H1 heading "Verify Your Email Address" at the top of the email body
- **After**: Removed H1, email now starts directly with "Hi {firstName},"
- **Impact**: Cleaner, less repetitive

### 2. Password Reset Template
**File**: `app/actions/password-reset.ts`
- **Subject**: "Reset Your Password"
- **Before**: Had H1 heading "Reset Your Password" at the top of the email body
- **After**: Removed H1, email now starts directly with "Hi {firstName},"
- **Impact**: Cleaner, less repetitive

### 3. Account Setup Template
**File**: `app/actions/send-account-setup-email.ts`
- **Subject**: "Complete Your Account Setup"
- **Before**: Had H1 heading "Welcome to MonthlyAlerts.com!" at the top
- **After**: Removed H1, email starts directly with the first paragraph
- **Impact**: Cleaner, more direct

## Templates Not Changed

The following email templates were reviewed and found acceptable:

### Welcome Email
**File**: `app/actions/send-welcome-email.ts`
- No H1 heading - already starts directly with "Hi there,"
- âœ… No changes needed

### Subscription Confirmation
**File**: `app/actions/send-subscription-email.ts`
- No H1 heading - starts directly with "Hi {firstName},"
- âœ… No changes needed

### Research Alerts
**File**: `app/actions/alerts.tsx`
- No headings - content comes from AI-generated research
- Subject dynamically generated based on company/ticker
- âœ… No changes needed

### Custom Messages
**File**: `app/actions/messages.tsx`
- No headings - content is fully custom from admin
- âœ… No changes needed

### Admin Notification
**File**: `app/actions/send-admin-notification.ts`
- Subject: "ðŸŽ‰ New Subscription"
- Has styled box with "ðŸŽ‰ New Subscription Received"
- âœ… Not an exact duplicate - "Received" adds context
- âœ… Serves as an alert/notification banner, not a redundant heading

## Result
