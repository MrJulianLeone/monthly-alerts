## üîç Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still Seeing Test Mode

**Symptoms:**
- Keys start with `pk_test_`
- Subscriptions go to test dashboard

**Fix:**
1. Verify Vercel environment variables are updated
2. Ensure you redeployed after updating variables
3. Clear browser cache and hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R)

### Issue: Webhook Not Firing

**Symptoms:**
- Subscription created in Stripe
- Not appearing in database
- Webhook logs show errors

**Fix:**
1. Check webhook endpoint URL is correct: `https://monthlyalerts.com/api/webhooks/stripe`
2. Verify `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in Vercel matches webhook secret in Stripe
3. Check Vercel logs for errors
4. Ensure webhook is in Live mode (not test mode)

### Issue: Payment Fails

**Symptoms:**
- Card is declined
- Error during checkout

**Fix:**
1. Ensure using a real card (not test card 4242...)
2. Check card has sufficient funds
3. Verify card isn't blocked by bank
4. Try different card

### Issue: 401 Webhook Error

**Cause:** Webhook secret mismatch

**Fix:**
1. Go to Stripe webhook settings
2. Reveal signing secret
3. Copy it exactly
4. Update `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in Vercel
5. Redeploy

### Issue: Database Not Updating

**Symptoms:**
- Stripe shows subscription
- Database has no record

**Fix:**
1. Check webhook logs in Stripe - any errors?
2. Check Vercel logs for application errors
3. Verify database connection in Vercel (`DATABASE_URL`)
4. Test database query manually

```

## üéâ After All Tests Pass
